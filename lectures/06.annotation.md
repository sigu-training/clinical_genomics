# Variants/genes annotation and prioritization


- Once annotated, variants need to be filtered and prioritized

  - WES: Tens of thousands
  - WGS: Millions

- **No universal filters, they depend on the experimental features**

---
### Variant impact

- First of all you usually want to filter variants by consequence on the encoded protein, keeping those which have an higher impact on protein:
 
  - Missense
  - Nonsense
  - Splice sites
  - Frameshift indels
  - Inframe indels

---
### Variant frequency
 
- Common variants are unlikely associated with a clinical condition
- A rare variant will probably have a higher functional effect on the protein
- Frequency cut-off have to be customized on each different case
- Typical cut-offs: 1% - 0.1%
- Allele frequencies may differ a lot between different populations

---
### Variant effect prediction Tools

- Tools that predict consequences of amino acid substitutions on protein function
- They give a score and/or a prediction in terms of "Tolerated", "Deleterious" (SIFT) or "Probably Damaging", "Possibly Damaging", "Benign" (Polyphen2)

### ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines

- the *American College of Medical Genetics* and the *Association for Molecular Pathology* published guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants in May of 2015 [(Richards S. et al, 2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/gim201530). This report describes updated standards and guidelines for classifying sequence variants by using criteria informed by expert opinion and experience

- 28 evaluation criteria for the clinical interpretation of variants
  - Criteria falls into 3 sets:
    - pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP)
    - benign/likely benign (B/LB)
    - variant of unknown significance (VUS)

- [**Intervar**](http://wintervar.wglab.org): software for automatically interpretation of the 28 criteria
  - Two major steps:
    - automatically interpretation by 28 criteria
    - manual adjustment to re-interpret the clinical significance

### Prioritization

- Phenotype-based prioritization 
  - Methods working by comparing the phenotypes of a patient with gene-phenotype known associations.

- [Phenolyzer](http://phenolyzer.wglab.org/): Phenotype Based Gene Analyzer, a tool to prioritize genes based on user-specific disease/phenotype terms
