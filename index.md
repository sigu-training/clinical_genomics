# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

In years 2018-2019, on behalf of the Italian Society of Human Genetics ([SIGU](https://www.sigu.net/)) an itinerant [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/)-based “hands-on-computer” training activity entitled “Data analysis and interpretation for clinical genomics” was held four times on invitation from different Italian institutions (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome, University of Genova, SIGU 2018 annual scientific meeting in Catania, University of Bari) and was offered to about 30 participants each time among clinical doctors, biologists, laboratory technicians and bioinformaticians. Topics covered by the course were NGS data quality check, detection of variants, copy number alterations and runs of homozygosity, annotation and filtering and clinical interpretation of sequencing results.

Realizing the constant need for training on NGS analysis and interpretation of sequencing data in the clinical setting, we designed an on-line [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/)-based training resource articulated in presentations and practical assignments by which students will learn how to approach NGS data quality at the level of fastq, bam and VCF files and clinically-oriented examination of variants emerging from sequencing experiments.

This training course is not to be intended as a tutorial on NGS pipelines and variant calling. This on-line training activity is indeed focused on data analysis for clinical interpretation. If you are looking for training on variant calling, visit this **Galaxy** tutorial on [Exome sequencing data analysis for diagnosing a genetic disease](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/exome-seq/tutorial.html).

# Next Generation Sequencing

*Next (or Second) Generation Sequencing* (NGS/SGS) is an umbrella-term covering a number of approaches to DNA sequencing that have been developed after the first, widespread and for long time most commonly used Sanger sequencing.

*NGS* is also known as *Massive Parallel Sequencing* (MPS), a term that makes explicit the paradigm shared by all these technologies, that is to sequence in parallel a massive library of spatially separated and clonally amplified DNA templates. 

For a comprehensive review of the different *NGS* technologies see [Goodwin et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2016.49), which also includes an introduction to the third generation methods allowing sequencing of long single-molecule reads.

## NGS in the clinic

In the span of less than a decade, NGS approaches have pervaded clinical laboratories revolutionizing genomic diagnostics and increasing yield and timeliness of genetic tests.

In the context of disorders with a recognized strong genetic contribution such as neurogenetic diseases, *NGS* has been firmly established as the strategy of choice to rapidly and efficiently diagnose diseases with a Mendelian basis. A general diagnostic workflow for these disorders currently embraces different *NGS*-based diagnostic options as illustrated in **Figure 1**.

---

 **Figure 1**. General workflow for genetic diagnosis of neurological diseases. (\*If considering high-yield single-gene testing of more than 1–3 genes by another sequencing method, note that next-generation sequencing is often most cost-effective. †Genetic counselling is required before and after all genetic testing; other considerations include the potential for secondary findings in genomic testing, testing parents if inheritance is sporadic or recessive, and specialty referral.) From [Rexach et al., 2019](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(19)30033-X/fulltext)

---

Currently, most common *NGS* strategies in clinical laboratories are the so-called **targeted sequencing** methods that, as opposed to **genome sequencing** covering the whole genomic sequence, focus on a pre-defined set of regions of interest (the **targets**). The targets can be selected by **hybrid capture** or **amplicon sequencing**, and the target-enriched libraries is then sequenced. The most popular target designs are:

 - **gene panels** where the coding exons of only a clinically-relevant group of genes are targeted
 - **exome sequencing** where virtually all the protein-coding exons in a genome are simultaneously sequenced

## Basics of NGS bioinformatic analysis

Apart from the different width of the target space in exome and gene panels, these two approaches usually share the same experimental procedure for NGS library preparation. After clonal amplification, the fragmented and adapter-ligated DNA templates are sequenced from both ends of the *insert* to produce short reads in opposite (**forward** and **reverse**) orientation (**paired-end** sequencing). 

Bioinformatic analysis of NGS data usually follows a general three-step workflow to variant detection. Each of these three steps is marked by its "milestone" file type containing sequence data in different formats and metadata describing sequence-related information collected during the analysis step that leads to generation of that file.

| NGS workflow step | File content | File format | File Size (individual exome) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sample to reads | Unaligned reads and qualities | **fastQ** | gigabytes |
| Reads to alignments | Aligned reads and metadata | **BAM** | gigabytes |
| Alignments to variants | Genotyped variants and metadata | **VCF** | megabytes |


Here are the different formats explained: 

- **[fastQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format)** (sequence with quality): the *de facto* standard for storing the output of high-throughput sequencing machines
  - Usually not inspected during data analysis
- **[BAM](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)** (binary sequence alignment/map): the most widely used TAB-delimited file format to store alignments onto a reference sequence
  - Aligned reads
- **[VCF](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf)** (variant call format): the standard TAB-delimited format for genotype information associated with each reported genomic position where a variant call has been recorded

Another useful file format is [BED](https://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/bed.html), to list genomic regions of interest such as the exome or panel targets.

The steps of the ***reads-to-variants*** workflow can be connected through a bioinformatic **pipeline** ([Leipzig et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5429012/)), consisting in read alignments, post-alignment BAM processing and variant calling.


## Alignment

As generated by the sequencing machines, *paired-end* reads are written to two *fastQ* files in which *forward* and *reverse* reads are stored separately together with their qualities. *FastQ* files are taken as input files by tools (the **aligners**) that align the reads onto a reference genome. One of the most used aligners is [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) among the many that have been developed (Figure 2).

---

![aligners_timeline]({{site.baseurl}}/images/aligners_timeline.png)

**Figure 2**. Aligners timeline 2001-2012 (from [Fonseca et al., 2012](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/24/3169/245777))

---
 
During the bioinformatic process, *paired-end* reads from the two separate *fastQ* files are re-connected in the alignment, where it is expected that they will:
- map to their correct location in the genome
- be as distant as the insert size of the fragment they come from
- be in opposite orientations
a combination which we refer to as **proper pairing**. All these data about *paired-end* reads mapping are stored in the BAM file and can be used to various purposes, from alignment quality assessment to structural variant detection.

In **Figure 3**, the [Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) screenshot of an exome alignment data over two adjacent *ASXL1* exons is shown. Pink and violet bars are *forward* and *reverse* reads, respectively. The thin grey link between them indicates that they are *paired-end* reads. The stack of reads is concentrated where exons are as expected in an exome, and the number of read bases covering a given genomic location *e* (depicted as a hill-shaped profile at the top of the figure) defines the **depth of coverage (DoC)** over that location:

*DoC*<sub>e</sub>=*number of read bases over e/genomic length of e*

## Post-alignment BAM processing

Regarding post-alignment *pipelines*, the most famous for germline SNP and InDel calling is probably that developed as part of the GATK toolkit (**Figure 4**).

---

![gatk_germline_pipeline]({{site.baseurl}}/images/gatk_germline_snps_indels.png)

**Figure 4**. After-alignment pipeline for germline SNP and InDel variant calling according to [GATK Best Practices](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/workflow?id=11145)

---

    
According to GATK best practices, in order to be ready for variant calling the BAM file should undergo the following processing:
- [marking duplicate reads](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/4.0.4.0/picard_sam_markduplicates_MarkDuplicates.php) to flag (or discard) reads that are mere optical or PCR-mediated duplications of the actual reads
- [recalibrating base quality scores](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11081) to correct known biases of the native base-related qualities
While GATK BAM processing is beyond doubt important to improve data quality, it has to be noticed that it is not needed to obtain variant calls and that non GATK-based pipelines may not use it or may use different quality reparametrization schemes. Duplicate flagging or removal is not recommended in *amplicon* sequencing experiments.

## Variant calling

The process of variant detection and genotyping is performed by *variant callers*. These tools use probabilistic approaches to collect evidence that non-reference read bases accumulating over a given locus support the presence of a variant, usually differing in algorithms, filtering strategies, recommendations ([Sandmann et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43169)). To be confident that a variant is a true event, its supporting evidence should be significantly stronger than chance; e.g. the C>T on the left of the screenshot in Figure 5 is supported by all its position-overlapping reads, claiming for a variant. In contrast, the C>A change on the right of the screenshot is seen only once over many reads, challenging its interpretation as a real variant. In fact, DNA variants that occur in germ cells (i.e., **germline/constitutional variants** that can be passed on to offspring) are either diploid/biallelic, so expected alternative allele frequency is 50% for a heterozygous change. On the other hand, if only a smaller subset of aligned reads indicates variation, that could result from technology bias or be a **mosaicism**, i.e. an individual which harbour two or more populations of genetically distinct cells as a result of postzygotic mutation. Postzygotic *de novo* mutations may result in **somatic mosaicism** (potentially causing a less severe and/or variable phenotype compared with the equivalent constitutive mutation) **and/or germline mosaicism** (hence enabling transmission of a pathogenic variant from an unaffected parent to his affected offspring) ([Biesecker et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3424)). To identify mosaicism, a probabilistic approach should consider deviation of the proband variant allele fraction (VAF, defined as the number of alternative reads divided by the total read depth) from a binomial distribution centred around 0.5.

![igv_screenshot_variant]({{site.baseurl}}/images/igv_variant.png)

**Figure 5**. Variant visualization by *IGV*

---

The GATK variant calling pipeline first produces a **genomic VCF ([gVCF](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/4017/what-is-a-gvcf-and-how-is-it-different-from-a-regular-vcf))**, whose main difference with *VCF* is that it records all sites in a target whether there is a variant or not, while *VCF* contains only information for variant sites, preparing multiple samples for **joint genotyping** and creation of a **multi-sample** *VCF* whose variants can undergo quality **filtering** in order to obtain the final set of quality-curated variants ready to be annotated.

In downstream analyses, annotations can be added to *VCF* files themselves or information in *VCF* files can be either annotated in TAB- or comma- deimited files to be visually inspected for *clinical* variant searching or used as input to **prioritization** programs.


# Quality control

Before data analysis, it is crucial to check the quality of the data at different levels of the analysis workflow:
 1. Raw sequences in FASTQ format
 1. BAM files containing the sequences aligned to the reference genome
 1. Final list of variants if VCF format

We will use several tools available at [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)
for checking the quality of data at each step of the analysis, as well as to evaluate the per-base coverage depth at specific genomic intervals

---
![Quality control overview]({{site.baseurl}}/images/qc_overview.png)
**Software for quality control**, at each step of the analysis workflow.

---

## Quality control of FASTQ files

We'll use the **FastQC** software, with the FASTQ files available in the Shared Data Libraries: *HighQuality_Reads.fastq* and 
*LowQuality_Reads.fastq*


*FastQC* is relatively easy to use. A detailed help can be found in the [help manual](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/). 

 - Copy the FASTQ file in your history from the Galaxy Shared Data Libraries
 - Select *FastQC* from the left panel
 - Select the FASTQ file as input
 - Click *Execute*

The output of FASTQC consists of multiple modules analysing a specific aspect of the quality of the data.

The names of the modules are preceded by an icon that reflects the quality of the data. The icon indicates whether the results of the module are:
 - normal (green)
 - slightly abnormal (orange)
 - very unusual (red)
 
These evaluations must be taken in the context of what you are expecting from your dataset. For FASTQC a *normal* includes random sequences with high diversity. If your experiment generates libraries biased in particular ways (e.g. low complexity libraries) you should consider the report with attention. In general, you should concentrate on the icons different from green and try to understand the reasons for this behaviour.

### Sequence quality by position

Phred scores represent base call quality. The higher the score the more reliable the base call. Often the quality of reads decreases over the length of the read. Therefore, it is common practice to plot the distribution of the Phred scores at each position using boxplots.
    
The average Phred score is depicted by the blue line, the median Phred score by the red line. The yellow boxes contain 50% of all Phred scores. The background of the graph divides the plot in three regions: good quality (green), reasonable quality (orange), poor quality (red; Phred score < 20).

Below examples of datasets with high (left) and low (right) sequence quality

![High Quality reads]({{site.baseurl}}/images/fastqc_sequence_quality.png)

### Check overall sequence quality
Calculates the average Phred score of each read and show a cumulative plot of the average qualities of all the reads.

### Check quality per tile
This plot is specific for Illumina flowcells which are divided into tiles. To check whether there is a loss in quality associated with a specific area of the flowcell, FASTQC plots the average quality scores for each tile across all positions in the reads. 

A good plot should be blue on all the area. Deviations from blue are positions where the quality was different from the average. Failures could be due to bubbles through the flowcells, presence of debris or, Illumina not patterned flow-cell, high density of clusters due to overlad. 
Failures affecting small areas of the flow-cell can be safely ignored.

### Check sequence duplication
Due to random fragmentation, in a diverse library generated by shearing most fragments will occur only once. High level of duplication may indicate enrichment bias such as library contamination or PCR over-amplification.

The plot shows the relative number of reads with different degrees of duplication.
 - The red line represents the number of **distinct** sequences that are duplicated, where the percentage is relative to the total number of distinct sequences
 - The blue line represents the counts of all the duplicated sequences, where the percentage is computed relative to the total number of reads

Most sequences should fall in the left part of the plot (low sequence duplication level).
Contaminants are visible as peaks in the blue line (high proportion of original sequences) but should be absent in the red line as they contribute as a minor fraction of the deduplicated dataset. If peaks are still present in the red line after deduplication, you may have a large number of different duplicated sequences which might indicate contamination.

### Check per base sequence content
In presence of random sequences, the fraction of A, C, G and T should be the same on each position, producing four straight lines on this plot, one for each nucleotide. However you will often see several peaks for the first positions. This bias in the first positions arises from the protocol used to generate RNA-Seq libraries, either transposase based or priming with random examers. The bias is not due to a single sequence, but depends on different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads, therefore cannot be removed by trimming a specific sequence from the 5' end.
However, the presence of such bias, if limited to the first bases, do not affect downstream analyses.

### Over-represented sequences

This module checks for the presence of specific sequences which are over-represented in your library, i.e. reads that make a substantial fraction (&gt; 0.1%) of the total number of reads. In this module only the first 50bp are considered by FASTQC. Each overrepresented sequence is compared to a list of common contaminants to try to identify it.

You can see which position of the read is greatly affected (plot), and check the list of possible contaminants in the table with the list of sequences which make &gt; 0.1% of the total reads.

For DNA-Seq ideally you shouldn't see any sequence in the table, even if a small fraction of adapter sequences can be observed, which can be easily removed by adding a step for adapter removal in the analysis pipeline. For RNA-Seq, highly abundant transcripts could be tracked as overrepresented sequences.

The presence of adapter sequences impacts the rate and speed of alignment.

## Computation of per-base coverage depth at specific genomic intervals

Commercial next-generation sequencing platform usually provide users with analysis programs that include tools for the identification of low coverage regions (for instance, target regions that have a coverage depth lower than 20x).

The present tutorial is aimed to show how to perform a custom coverage analysis
of NGS experiment(s) by using tools that are available in Galaxy.

Starting material:
* Alignment (*bam*) file(s) on which you want to perform the coverage evaluation.
* A reference *bed* file listing the genomic regions for which you want to obtain coverage data. If you performed a targeted sequencing experiment by using commercial kits (either custom or from the catalogue), you should already have obtained a *bed* file listing the target regions: it should be the file you want to use.

Practically speaking, it means that the starting position is diminished by 1 bp with respect to the actual position. For instance, the region "chr2 50149071 50149399" in a *bed* file corresponds to the genomic interval from position 50149072 (included) to position 50149399 (included) on chromosome 2 (when the first base of the chromosome is defined as position 1). If you want to indicate a single base position in a *bed* file, it should be written like this: "chr2 50149071 50149072" .

### Final notes
The procedures listed above are to be taken as examples of the possible operations that can be performed on bed files with bedtools (you may check out their website to get further information:
[BEDtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/bedtools-suite.html)) ad text manipulation tools available on Galaxy.

Furthermore, please be aware that the tool `bedtools Compute both the depth and breadth of coverage` does not perform any filtering based on read quality: if your are interested in that aspect you may want to rely on different tools. 

# Variant calling and classification

After the generation of a high-quality set of mapped read pairs, we can proceed to call different classes of DNA variants. To this aim, the tools **HaplotypeCaller** and **MuTect2** from **[GATK toolkit](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us)** are a dedicated solution for DNA variant identification at germinal- and somatic-level. They can:

- Determine haplotypes by local assembly of the genomic regions in which the samples being analyzed show substantial evidence of variation relative to the reference;
- Evaluate the evidence for haplotypes and variant alleles;
- Assigning per-sample genotypes.

# Variant annotation

Once called, variants (SNPs and InDels) need to be annotated.

We want to know for example if a variant is located in a gene, if it’s in the coding portion of that gene, if it causes an aminoacid substitution, if that substitution is deleterious for the encoded protein function.

**Variant annotation** is the process of attaching technical and/or biological information from multiple available source (e.g. **public databases**) to variants

---
## Gene model

The choice of gene model is essential for variant downstream variant annotation: it describe genomic positions of genes and each exon-intron exact locations

Different gene models can give different annotations:
![BRCA1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/brca1_var.jpg)

**Figure 1.** Variant indicated by the red dashed line can be annotated as *intronic* or *exonic* (on one of the UCSC transcript variants), depending on the adopted gene model:

- [RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/)
- [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index)
- [Gencode](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/)

## Annotation and filtering with wANNOVAR

The web tool [wANNOVAR](http://wannovar.wglab.org/index.php) allows for rapid annotation of your variants and for some basic filtering steps to find disease genes.
It is based on its command line counterpart [ANNOVAR](http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/), but it is more user-friendly since it does not require any programming skills.

The output consist in tabular text files that can be easily manipulated with Excel or other spreadsheet programs.

The annotation is performed against some of the most commonly used databases: RefSeq, UCSC Known, ENSEMBL/Genecode, dbSNP, ClinVar, 1000genomes, ExAC, ESP6500, gnomAD (minor allele frequencies in different populations are reported) and various precalculated prediction scores for any possible single nucleotide variant in coding regions (see [dbNSFP](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP)). 

The gene-based annotation results in a single row for each input variant: only the most deleterious consequence is reported (i.e.: if a certain variant may result to be missense for one transcript and nonsense for a second transcript, only the latter consequence will be reported).

Unfortunately, unlike the command line version, wANNOVAR does neither allow for the use of custom annotation databases, nor for the selection of different pubblicly available databases.

To annotate your file with wANNOVAR you need to provide your email address, to be notified when the annotation is complete, and just upload your input file (or paste a series of variant in the designated field). Results are usually ready within minutes.
![Figure 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/wann_fig1.png)


You will get both *csv* files or *txt* files (which can be saved as they are by clicking on the specific link, right-clicking in any point of the page and selecting `Save as`). They can be both opened with Excel or other spreadsheet programs (concerning *csv* files, please ensure that comma are set as default list separator/delimiter in your version of Excel).

You will also get both `exome summary results` (only conding variants are included) and `genome summary results` (all variants included).

You can also provide a list of Disease or Phenotype Terms that the program can use for filtering your results (only for single sample `vcf` files).
![Figure 2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/wann_fig2.png)

Finally, there are some Parameter Settings that can be modified:
 - Result duration: it can now only be set to "1 day", since your files will be automatically removed after 24 hours.
 - Reference genome: you can choose between hg19 (GRCh37) and hg38 (GRCh38).
 - Input Format: you can upload not only *vcf* files, but also other kinds of variant files.
 - Gene Definition: the database you want to use for gene function annotation. Three oprtions are available: RefSeq, UCSC Known, ENSEMBL/Gencode
 - Individual analysis: the "Individual analysis" option allows you to perform further filtering steps (based on the Disease/Phenotype terms or the Disease Model) on a single sample (if you upload a multisample *vcf* only the first sample will be considered); the "All Annotaions" option will annotate all variants in your multisample *vcf*, maintaining the original columns of your *vcf* as the last columns of your output file.
 - Disease Model: this options allows for some basic filtering of your variants based on the expected mechanism of inheritance. In mainly consider frequencies, sample genotypes and consequences at level of genic function. FIltering step are summarized among the results and they are only performed on a single sample: the program does not perform any multisample evaluation (i.e.: variant segregation in a trio) and cannot classify any variant as de novo even if you provide a multisample *vcf* with parental genotypes.

## Clinical databases for further manual variant annotation

Once you have obtained a file with the annotation of your variants, you might find useful to annotate also the involved genes, in order to know, for instance, the list of diseases that may be associated with them.

Some databases that can the jb are the following:
 1. The gene2phenotype dataset ([G2P](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype/disclaimer)) integrates data on genes, variants and phenotypes for example relating to developmental disorders. In the "Download" section you will find both databases of genes related to cancer and to developmental disorders. Those files report for each gene listed: the OMIM number, the associated disease name, the disease OMIM number, the disease category (you can fing more details in the "Terminology" section), whether the disease is caused by biallelic or monoallelic variants ("allelic requirement"), the expected category of variant to be causative of the disease, and a few other details.
 1. In the "Download" section of the [OMIM database](https://www.omim.org/downloads/), if you register for research and educational use, you may obtain different lists of OMIM genes and their associated phenotypes.
 1. Among the files available for download from the [gnomAD database](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads#constraint), you may get per-gene constraint scores (for further details, please check the paper by the Exome Aggregation Consortium on "Nature. 2016 Aug 18; 536(7616):285–291."). Those score may indicate if a specific gene is expected to be intolerant to loss-of-function variants (pLI) (haploinsufficiency), or if it is predicted to be associate to recessive diseases.

In the end, you can add these annotations to your wANNOVAR files by using the `VLOOKUP` function in Excel.

# Variant prioritization

Once annotated, variants need to be filtered and prioritized

 - WES: Tens of thousands
 - WGS: Millions

**No universal filters, they depend on the experimental features**

## Variant impact

First of all you usually want to filter variants by consequence on the encoded protein, keeping those which have an higher impact on protein:
 
- Missense
- Nonsense
- Splice sites
- Frameshift indels
- Inframe indels

## Variant frequency
 
- Common variants are unlikely associated with a clinical condition
- A rare variant will probably have a higher functional effect on the protein
- Frequency cut-off have to be customized on each different case
- Typical cut-offs: 1% - 0.1%
- Allele frequencies may differ a lot between different populations

## Variant effect prediction Tools

- Tools that predict consequences of amino acid substitutions on protein function
- They give a score and/or a prediction in terms of "Tolerated", "Deleterious" (SIFT) or "Probably Damaging", "Possibly Damaging", "Benign" (Polyphen2)
  
  - fitCons
  - GERP++
  - SIFT
  - PolyPhen2
  - CADD
  - DANN
  - Condel
  - fathmm
  - MutationTaster
  - MutationAssessor
  - REVEL

## ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines

The *American College of Medical Genetics* and the *Association for Molecular Pathology* published guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants in May of 2015 [(Richards S. et al, 2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/gim201530). This report describes updated standards and guidelines for classifying sequence variants by using criteria informed by expert opinion and experience

- 28 evaluation criteria for the clinical interpretation of variants. Criteria falls into 3 sets:
  - pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP)
  - benign/likely benign (B/LB)
  - variant of unknown significance (VUS)

- [**Intervar**](http://wintervar.wglab.org): software for automatical interpretation of the 28 criteria. Two major steps:
 - automatical interpretation by 28 criteria
 - manual adjustment to re-interpret the clinical significance

## Prioritization

Phenotype-based prioritization tools are methods working by comparing the phenotypes of a patient with gene-phenotype known associations.

- [Phenolyzer](http://phenolyzer.wglab.org/): Phenotype Based Gene Analyzer, a tool to prioritize genes based on user-specific disease/phenotype terms

# CNV detection from targeted sequencing data

- *Copy Number Variants* (CNVs) are imbalances in the copy number of the genomic material that result in either DNA **deletions** (copy loss) or **duplications**
- *CNVs* can cause/predispose to human diseases by altering gene structure/dosage or by **position effect**
- *CNV* size ranges from 50 bp to megabases
- Classical methods to identify *CNVs* use array-based technologies (SNP/CGH)
- Computational approaches have been developed to identify *CNVs* in targeted sequencing data from **hybrid capture** experiments

## Computational approaches

There are four main methods for *CNV* identification from short-read +NGS data (see figure below):
 - **Read Count** (RC)
 - **Read Pair** (RP)
 - **Split Read** (SR)
 - **De Novo Assembly** (AS)
  
  
 - *RP* and *SR* require continuous coverage of the *CNV* region or reads encompassing *CNV* breakpoints, as in whole genome sequencing. The sparse nature and small size of exonic targets hamper the application of these methods to targeted sequencing. 
 - *RC* is the best suited method for *CNV* detection from whole exomes or gene panels where:
  - deletions appear as exonic targets devoid of reads
  - duplications appear as exonic targets characterized by excess of coverage

---

---

## RC method and data normalization

In targeted sequencing, a method to study DNA copy number variation by *RC* (as implemented in *EXCAVATOR* tool, [Magi et al., 2013](http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R120))) is to consider the **exon mean read count** (EMRC):

*EMRC* = *RC*<sub>e</sub>/*L*<sub>e</sub>

where *RC*<sub>e</sub> is the number of reads aligned to a target genomic region e and *L*<sub>e</sub> is the size of that same genomic region in base pairs ([Magi et al., 2013](http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R120))).
Three major bias sources are known to affect *EMRC* dramatically in targeted sequencing data:
- local **GC content** percentage
- genomic **mappability**
- target region **size**

These biases contribute to non uniform read depth across target regions and, together with the sparse target nature, challenge the applicability of *RC* methods to targeted data. As shown in Figure 2 (left panel), in single-sample data the *EMRC* distributions of genomic regions characterized by different copy numbers largely overlap, revealing poor *CNV* prediction capability. 

*EMRC ratio* between two samples can be used as a normalization procedure. The effect of *EMRC ratio*-based normalization is clear in Figure 2 (right panel) as a markedly improved correspondece between the predicted and the real copy number states.

**Figure 2**. Effect of *EMRC ratio* on DNA copy number prediction (adapted from [Magi et al., 2013](http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R120))

---
    
Similarly FPKM, a normalized measure of read depth implemented in ExomeDepth tool ([Plagnol et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts526)), is affected by extensive exon–exon variability but comparison between pairs of exome datasets demonstrates high correlation level of the normalized read count data across samples making it possibile to use one or more combined exomes as reference set to base the CNV inference on ([Plagnol et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts526)).

## *CNV* detection accuracy

Strong correlation is observed between Affymetrix array-SNP and exome-derived data for *CNVs* >1 Mb (Figure 4, right panel), while including CNVs of any size dramatically decreases the correlation level (Figure 4, left panel). This can be explained by the different distribution of exons and SNP probes throughout the genome. Candidate *CNV* regions as identified by *EXCAVATOR* contain a comparable number of exons and SNP probes when they are > 1 Mb (*R*=0.8), while regions <100 Kb do not (*R*=-0.02). Accordingly, [Krumm et al., 2012](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/8/1525.full) report 94% precision in detecting *CNVs* across three or more exons.

To increase chances to detect *CNVs* encompassing few exons or in non-coding regions from exome data, [D'Aurizio et al., 2016](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/44/20/e154/2607979) have proposed an extension to *EXCAVATOR* to exploit off-target read count (*EXCAVATOR2*). Similar approaches taking advantage of off-target reads have been described by [Bellos et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4147927/) or [Talevich et al., 2016](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004873).

## Tools for *CNV* detection from gene panels or exome data

A number of tools or pipelines implementing modified versions of previously published tools have been reported to detect single-exon *CNVs* in clinical gene panels:
- [CoNVaDING](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/humu.22969)
- [DeCON](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/1-20/v1)
- [ExomeDepth v1.1.6](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg201742)
- [Atlas-CNV](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-019-0475-4)
- [DeviCNV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6192323/)

In addition to the above-mentioned methods, many tools have been developed that detect *CNVs* from exomes. Evaluation of these tools is not straightforward as there is lack of a gold standard for comparison. As a consequence, there is no consensus level on pipelines as high as for single nucleotide variants. [Zare et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452530/pdf/12859_2017_Article_1705.pdf) have reviewed this topic with focus on cancer, reporting poor overlap of different tools and added challenges for somatic variant calling.

# Regions of Homozygosity

- *Runs of Homozygosity* (ROHs) are sizeable stretches of consecutive homozygous markers encompassing genomic regions where the two haplotypes are identical
- Haplotypes in *ROHs* can underlie identity either by **state** (IBS) or by **descent** (IBD). IBD occurs when two haplotypes originate from a common ancestor (Figure 1), a condition whcih we refer to as **autozygosity**
- *Autozygosity* in an individual is the hallmark of high levels of genomic inbreeding (g*F*), often occurring in the offspring from consanguineous unions where parents are related as second-degree cousins or closer
- The most well-known medical impact of parental consanguinity is the increased risk of rare autosomal recessive diseases in the progeny, with excess risk inversely proportional to the disease-allele frequency ([Bittles, 2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1034/j.1399-0004.2001.600201.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed))

## Homozygosity mapping

- We refer to *homozygosity mapping* ([Lander and Botstein, 1987](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/236/4808/1567.long)) as an approach that infers *autozygosity* from the detection of long ROHs to map genes associated with recessive diseases
- A classical strategy to identify *ROHs* is based on SNP-array data and analysis with [PLINK](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/)
- The combination of *homozygosity mapping* with exome sequencing has boosted genomic research and diagnosis of recessive diseases in recent years ([Alazami et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124714010444?via%3Dihub); [Monies et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502059/))
- *ROHs* may be of clinical interest also since they can unmask **uniparental isodisomy**
- Computational approaches have been developed to identify *ROHs* directly in exome data, allowing **simultaneous detection of variants and surrounding ROHs** from the same datasets.


## Computational approaches

As for CNVs, the sparse nature and small size of exonic targets are a challenge for the identification of continuous strethces of homozygous markers throughout the genome. This may affect the performance of tools originally tailored to SNPs when applied to exome data. 

In Figure 2 a synthetic overview is given of algorithms, input data and output file types in bioinformatic tools for exome-based *ROH* detection. *ROHs* are divided in three size classes reflecting different mechanisms that have shaped them (according to [Pemberton et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929712003230?via%3Dihub)). 

Usually, long ROH (approximately >1.5 Mb) arise as a result of close parental consanguinity, but also short-medium *ROHs* can be of medical interest in populations as involved in disease susceptibility, natural selection and founder effects ([Ceballos et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.109)).

### H<sup>3</sup>M<sup>2</sup>

*H<sup>3</sup>M<sup>2</sup>* ([Magi et al., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/20/2852/2422169)) is based on an heterogeneous [*Hidden Markov Model*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) (HMM) that incorporates inter-marker distances to detect *ROHs* from exome data.

*H<sup>3</sup>M<sup>2</sup>* calculates B-allele frequencies of a set of polymorphic sites throughout the exome as the ratio between allele *B* counts and the total read count at site *i*:

*BAF*<sub>i</sub> = *N<sub>b</sub>/N*

*H<sup>3</sup>M<sup>2</sup>* retrieves *BAF*<sub>i</sub> **directly from BAM files** to predict the heterozygous/homozygous genotype state at each polymorphic position *i*:

- when *BAF*<sub>i</sub> \~ 0 the predicted genotype is **homozygous reference**
- when *BAF*<sub>i</sub> \~ 0.5 the predicted genotype is **heterozygous**
- when *BAF*<sub>i</sub> \~ 1 the predicted genotype is **homozygous alternative**

*H<sup>3</sup>M<sup>2</sup>* models *BAF* data by means of the *HMM* algorithm to discriminate between regions of homozygosity and non-homozygosity according to the *BAF* distribution along the genome (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**. ***BAF* data distribution** Panels a, b and c show the distributions of BAF values against the genotype calls generated by the HapMap consortium on SNP-array data ( a ), the genotype calls made by SAMtools ( b ) and the genotype calls made by GATK ( c ). For each genotype caller, the distribution of BAF values is reported for homozygous reference calls (HMr), heterozygous calls (HT) and homozygous alternative calls (HMa). R is the Pearson correlation coefficient. Panels d–g show the distribution of BAF values in all the regions of the genome ( d ), in heterozygous regions ( e ), in homozygous regions ( f ) and in the X chromosome of male individuals ( g ). For each panel, the main plot reports the zoomed histogram, the left subplot shows the BAF values against genomic positions, whereas the right subplot shows the entire histogram of BAF values.
